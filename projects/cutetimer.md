I have a problem at work. When I get locked in, I forget to take breaks. Breaks are great for the body and the mind because they help prevent repetitive stress injuries and increase creativity. To fix this, I created a Pomodoro timer for IOS (and soon to be web). I wanted something very simple, without ads, that would not track me. I could not find anything that satisfied these requirements so I built my own!
