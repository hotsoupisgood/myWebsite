I have a problem at work. When I get locked in, I forget to take breaks. Breaks are great for the body, because they prevent repetitive stress injuries, as well as the mind because they can help you create new ideas. So to fix this, I created a Pomodoro timer for IOS (and soon to be web). I wanted something very simple, without ads, that would not track me. I could not find anything that satisfied these requirements so I built my own!
