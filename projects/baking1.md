## Focaccia recipe
#### Ingredients
Dough:
* 2 cups flour (Substituting 1 cup for rye or whole wheat will work fine, and lead to a hardier dough)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon brown sugar
* 1.5 teaspoon instant yeast
* 1 cup warm water
* 1 teaspoon evoo
Toppings:
* chopped olives
* chopped garlic
* rosemary
* evoo
 
#### Directions
1. Heat up water to room temperature
2. Mix in sugar, and yeast. Let rest.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together your flour and salt.
4. In a small bowl, combine chopped olives, garlic, rosemary and a few tablespoons of evoo. Let rest.
5. Combine the sugar-yeast-water and one tablespoon of evoo with the dry ingredients and mix together with a spatula until fully combined. The dough should be very wet. I like to describe it as halfway between pancake batter and a country loaf.
6. Oil up a separate large bowl with evoo. We are putting the dough in here and do not want it to stick.
7. Carefully place dough in the new bowl.
8. Let rest, covered in a damp towel until doubled in size (1-3 hours).
9. Oil your hands and punch the dough down until deflated.
10. Pinch and stretch the dough up and fold it onto itself. Do this ~5 times, or until you are satisfied with yourself.
11. Place into an oiled baking instrument, I prefer a 10" cast iron skillet.
12. Let dough rest until doubled in size (1 hour). Be conservative with this step. Overproving can lead to denser dough.
13. Preheat your oven so it is ready when the dough is.
14. Oil your fingers and press, fingers spread, all the way into the dough until your finger tips touch the metal underneath. Do this until there are dimples roughly every 2cm.
15. Evenly spread your topping mixture on the dough.
16. Cook for 20 minutes, or until lightly browned.
17. Place on cooling rack until eating temperature.
