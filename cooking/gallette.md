#### Ingredients
Topping:
* A topping ( Enough to fill the top, extras wont hurt, I have tried strawberry, rhubarb, and apples with great success )
* Enough sugar to coat topping in bowl

Dough: 
* 160g all-purpose flour
* 12 g sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 115g cubed unsalted butter at fridge temp
* 70 g ice water
  
Frangipane: 
* 55g almond flour
* 30 g sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 30 g butter at room temperature
* 1 egg
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* Orange zest + splash of juice ( Optional )

Instructions

0. Evenly slice the topping and put it in a bowl with sugar to breakdown. ( May produce liquid that you can withhold at the end )
1. Heat the oven to 400ÂºF. 
2. To make the crust. In a food processor, pulse flour, sugar and salt together. 
3. Add the cold, cubed butter to the food processor. 
4. Pulse until the butter is the size of peas. Add ice water and pulse again until the mixture is crumbly.
5. Lay a clean towel or cling wrap on a work surface, then dump the dough mixture into the center. 
6. Grab the opposite corners of the wrap together and twist to compress the mixture, pressing the air out and forming into a ball.
7. Put dough ball in fridge.
8. No need to wash food processor.
9. For the frangipane. Combine almond flour, sugar, salt, butter, egg, and vanilla in the food processor. Mix until smooth.
10. Lightly flour a work surface, roll out the dough into a 12+ inch circle, dusting flour when needed to prevent sticking. Transfer dough to a silicone pad for cooking, or parchment paper if you don't have. 
11. Spread the frangipane into the center leaving a 3+ cm border. 
12. Arrange your topping in an aesthetic pattern on top.
13. Fold excess dough over to make a nice package. 
14. Brush exposed dough with egg wash mixed with a little dairy ( half and half or milk ).
15. Sprinkle a little brown sugar on top of exposed dough. Add little knobs of button on the topping.
16. Bake for 35 minutes or until golden brown.
